# Gobotics Game

**Gobotics** is physics simulation software that allows you to test objects like robots and more.

This repository contains only the application code. Examples of physical models such as robots or others are available on the [gobotics-assets repository](https://github.com/LD2Studio/gobotics-assets).

## Features

- Simulates all rigid physical objects.
- The design of the robots is implemented in Gobotics based on a description that follows the [URDF standard](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML). Only *fixed*, *continuous*, *revolute* and *prismatic* joints are supported at the moment.
- The robots can be controlled manually from the keyboard or a gamepad.
- The robots are accessible from a Python script to control them remotely (still limited use).

Features still missing are sensors, cameras, ... To be continued.
