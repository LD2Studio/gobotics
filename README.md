# Gobotics Game

**Gobotics** is a physics simulation software that allows you to test objects like robots and more.

## Features

- Simulates all rigid physical objects.
- The design of the robots is implemented in Gobotics based on a description that follows the [URDF standard](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML). Only *fixed*, *continuous*, *revolute* and *prismatic* joints are supported at the moment.
- Ray sensor is implemented (like **Lidar**), camera, etc.
- The robots can be controlled manually from the keyboard or a gamepad.
- The robots are accessible from a Python script to control them remotely (still limited use).
- Extra URDF tags for Gobotics (Differential Drive, Grouped joints, 4 Mecanum wheels Drive).
